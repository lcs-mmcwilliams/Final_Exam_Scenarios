/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image:
 
 ![dead-kennedys-no-grid](1-DeadKennedys.png "Dead Kennedys")
 ![dead-kennedys-with-grid](1-DeadKennedys-with-grid.png "Dead Kennedys")
 
 For colors, use the color constants provided below.
 
 ### Gentle reminders
 
 Remember to [review the exam rubric here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrVW7NGsNNtXA9ibPEN8LciL4sBalBvS/view). Code readability and efficiency matters.
 
 You are encouraged to collaborate with other students while practicing to reproduce the target image.
 
 Remember that on exam day, you will not have access to any code you have previously written on your computer.
 
 Mr. Gordon can help you understand and complete the five exam prep images:
 
 1. [Blur](https://github.com/lcs-ics2o-2017/Final_Exam_Practice_Task_1)
 2. [Subhumans](https://github.com/lcs-ics2o-2017/Final_Exam_Practice_Task_2)
 3. [Undertones](https://github.com/lcs-ics2o-2017/Final_Exam_Practice_Task_3)
 4. [The Runaways](https://github.com/lcs-ics2o-2017/Final_Exam_Practice_Task_4)
 5. [Pixies](https://github.com/lcs-ics2o-2017/Final_Exam_Practice_Task_5)
 
 You can also refer to [syntax examples and review materials in this playground](https://github.com/lcs-ics2o-2017/exam-review-key-concepts).
 
 Be advised that Mr. Gordon cannot help you program or make a plan for any of the actual exam images.
 
 In short â€“ practice, place key notes on your index card, and you will be fine.
 
 You can do this! ðŸ˜€

// Create a new canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 400, height: 600)

// Color constants
let orange = Color(hue: 25, saturation: 87, brightness: 96, alpha: 100)

// NOTE:
// Recall that black can be achieved with a hue of
// 0, a saturation of 0, and a brightness of 0.
// From there, you may adjust the alpha as needed.

// Begin your solution below...



//background
canvas.fillColor = orange
canvas.drawRectangle(bottomLeftX: 0, bottomLeftY: 0, width: 400, height: 600)

//Canvas Position
canvas.translate(byX: 10, byY: 350)
canvas.rotate(by: 40)
canvas.drawAxes()

//"dead Kennedys"
canvas.drawText(message: "dead kennedys", size: 45, x: 20, y: 0)
